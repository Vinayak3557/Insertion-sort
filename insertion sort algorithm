Step 1 - If the element is the first element, assume that it is already sorted. Return 1.
Step2 - Pick the next element, and store it separately in a key.
Step3 - Now, compare the key with all elements in the sorted array.
Step 4 - If the element in the sorted array is smaller than the current element, then move to the next element. Else, shift greater elements in the array towards the right.
Step 5 - Insert the value.
Step 6 - Repeat until the array is sorted.



insertionSort(array)
  mark first element as sorted
  for each unsorted element X
    'extract' the element X
    for j <- lastSortedIndex down to 0
      if current element j > X
        move sorted element to the right by 1
    break loop and insert X here
end insertionSort
